# ShinyConf 2025

# Optimizing Performance in Shiny: Tips and Best Practices

## Requirements  

1. Create an account at <https://posit.cloud/>. The free version is sufficient.  
2. Create a project using one of the following methods:  
   - From this repository: <https://github.com/Appsilon/shinyconf-2025-workshop-performance>  
   - By saving a copy of this project: <https://posit.cloud/content/9275522>  
3. Run *source* on the following file: `"scripts/01_setup.R"`  

No local setup is required for participants, as all code and exercises will be run on the platform.  

However, it is possible to clone the repository locally and execute the setup script.  

## Instructions  

- Presentation: <https://appsilon.github.io/shinyconf-2025-workshop-performance/>  

The **app.R** file contains the code for the Shiny app we will optimize.  
The **"./scripts/02_app_slow.R"** branch is a copy of this file before optimization, while the **"./scripts/03_app_fast.R"** file  
contains some of the optimizations presented in the workshop.
